# who-am-i

Hello, I'm someone that's random (wow very funni) and who is French (you can start running) from the wet lands of Normandy.

A nerd in sophomore who pass time to file bugs, hold doors and that does nothing.

Also loves (too much) Panzani pasta and Leclerc.

I plan NOT to use AI in the future. (>=3) Making by hand is better and helps revealing mistakes.
